## Capstone Overview

[Ada Family Tree](https://adafamilytree.herokuapp.com/) is a web application that aims to accomplish two main objectives:

* Visually map the growth of the Ada social network
* Help members of the Ada family connect and learn more about members of our Ada community

This app will provide an Ada family tree to help us not only keep track of teachers and their cohort of students, but also visually map the growth of the Ada student network. Clicking on members of the tree will provide basic information (e.g. name, cohort, linkedIn, and optional capstone information). This app may be used by Ada staff who would like to view, edit, or share the family tree.

## Problem Statement
Ada has a growing legacy wall of photos that documents its previous and current cohort of Ada students. For many of us, we've learned about former Adies from this "wall" of photos, in addition to meet-ups, occasional anecdotes, LinkedIn, and of course Google. However, the wall comes with its limitations and limited real estate.

The Ada Family Tree capstone project attempts to provide a digital platform to enhance how we connect and visualize the explosive growth of our Ada community. Using PostgreSQL, Python, Django and Data-Driven-Documents (D3), the Ada Family Tree can be used to map the expansion of Ada's ever-growing social network, make connections with other members of the Ada family, and encourage the flow of knowledge sharing.
