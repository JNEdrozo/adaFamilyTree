## Capstone Overview
This app will provide an Ada family tree to help us not only keep track of teachers and their cohort of students, but also visually map the growth of the Ada student network. Clicking on members of the tree will provide basic information (e.g. name, cohort, linkedIn, and optional capstone information). This app may be used by Ada staff who would like to view, edit, or share the family tree.
